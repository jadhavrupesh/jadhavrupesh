I am a Senior Mobile Developer with over five years of experience delivering secure, scalable, and high-performance applications. I have a proven track record of success across diverse industries, including **FinTech, Banking, Hospitality, Logistics, and E-commerce**. Over the years, I’ve contributed to end-to-end product lifecycles, from ideation and architecture to deployment and maintenance.

I enjoy building products from the ground up, solving complex engineering challenges, and mentoring teams to adopt modern best practices. My focus is on **Clean Architecture**, **MVVM**, and **multi-module design**, ensuring long-term maintainability and scalability of applications. I take pride in writing clean, testable, and production-grade code while always prioritizing performance and security.

I specialize in **Android (Kotlin, Java)**, **Flutter**, and **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)**, enabling me to build for multiple platforms efficiently. My professional experience includes payment gateway integrations (Razorpay), maps and localization (Google Maps/Translate), real-time communication (Agora, WebSockets), and secure data storage (Room, Firebase). Beyond frontend and mobile work, I have backend exposure using **Ktor** and **Firebase**, and I’ve designed **CI/CD pipelines** with Jenkins and Codemagic for automated delivery. I am also proficient in **VAPT hardening**, code reviews, and performance optimization.

Recognized for my problem-solving mindset, I’ve built and optimized solutions that balance innovation with reliability. I actively explore new technologies like **Compose Multiplatform** and **state management patterns** to stay ahead in the fast-moving mobile ecosystem.
